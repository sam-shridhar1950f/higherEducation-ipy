A notebook that analyzes data from several higher education insitutions in the United States. This analysis was conducted for TSA's 2021 National Leadership Conference's (NLC) Data Science & Analytics semifinalist scenario challenge. The notebook contains some exploratory data analysis and a decision tree to predict whether a college is public or private based on its data.
